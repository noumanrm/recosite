        <p>The founder of RECO Intensive, RECO Institute, and RECO Trust, David works with a tireless enthusiasm to create a more progressive approach to addiction treatment. A native Atlantan, Dave was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis at birth, and was later forced to reconcile with the reality that his life would be cut short as a result of his disease. By the age of 14, he had become apathetic toward his own health, and had begun abusing illicit drugs on a daily basis.</p>
        <p>In 2008, after combatting several years of intense drug addiction and countless setbacks in his recovery, Dave committed himself fully to achieving sobriety. Following an excruciating two-month detox period, he completed 70 days in rehabilitation, before relocating to a long-term sober living facility in Delray Beach. Today, he continues to make his home in South Florida as he thrives in his recovery, and also serves as a resilient advocate for the sober community.</p>
        <p>After both attending and working for multiple treatment programs himself, Dave acknowledged an intrinsic need to bridge a significant gap in the shadowy domain of early recovery. Determined to raise the bar for transitional care, he took his experience in the field and launched his own Residential Housing Facilities, known as the RECO Institute. From there, his dream program only continued to grow.</p>
        <p>Through the evolution of RECO Institute, RECO Intensive, and RECO Trust, Dave and his team have endeavored to create a safe, nonjudgmental environment that allows clients the opportunity to reclaim for themselves the life that addiction has stolen.</p>
        <p>As he maintains his own sobriety and positively impacts the sobriety of others, Dave believes deeply in the potential of each client—past, current, and future—who enters RECO’s program. Little by little, he recognizes their individual revolutions toward recovery, and celebrates in their success.</p>
        <p>A proud leader of team RECO, in his spare time Dave enjoys playing softball, sampling different cuisines, cementing his status as a certified movie buff, and surfing the Floridian waves.</p>
